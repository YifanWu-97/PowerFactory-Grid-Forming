# PowerFactory-Grid-Forming
This repository contains the PowerFactory models of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following model implemented in a 4-bus benchmark system, which is used in our ISGT paper:

Y. Wu, G. Verbiƒç and A. S. Ahmadyar, "Modelling of Grid-forming Inverters for Power System Applications in DIgSILENT PowerFactory".

These two files correspond to two aspects we focused on grid-forming control: system inertia and system strength. Each one of the files is a folder in PowerFactory, which contains three models: the synchronous machine-only model, the grid-following model, and the grid-forming model.

The modelling process and theoretical explanations can be found in the paper.

These files are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but without any warranty.

We do require publications to explicitly acknowledge the adoption of these models by citing the paper mentioned above.

If you have any questions or advice, please contact us: yifan.wu@sydney.edu.au.

Hope it helps.


Best regards,

Yifan
