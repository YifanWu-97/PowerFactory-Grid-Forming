# PowerFactory-Grid-Forming
This repository contains the PowerFactory models of Grid-Forming and Grid-following model, as well as a 4-bus benchmark system, which is used in our ISGT paper.

These two files correspond to two aspects we focused on grid-forming control: system inertia and system strength.

Each one of the files is a folder in PowerFactory, which contains three models: the synchronous machine-only model, the grid-following model, and the grid-forming model.

The modelling process and theoretical explanations can be found in the paper, which I will put the link here shortly.

We do require publications to explicitly acknowledge the adoption of these models by citing the above-mentioned papers.

If you have any questions or advice, please contact us: yifan.wu@sydney.edu.au.

Hope it helps.

Best regards,
Yifan
